# cleanmac
Clean your macOS with a script, not an expensive app

## Usage  

**Download the script and make it executable:**  
```shell  
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hkdobrev/cleanmac/refs/heads/main/cleanmac.sh  
chmod +x cleanmac.sh  
```  

**Preview what will be deleted and how much space will be freed:**  
```shell  
./cleanmac.sh --dry-run  
```  

**Run the script to clean up the files:**  
```shell  
./cleanmac.sh  
```
